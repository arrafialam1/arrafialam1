# Hi there! 👋 I'm Ar Rafi Alam Chowdhury  
I’m an aspiring **Data Scientist** whose journey began with a degree in Nuclear Science & Engineering—a field that taught me to approach complex problems with precision and curiosity. Early on, I immersed myself in technical research, co-authoring papers on developing intelligent safety systems for nuclear facilities and analyzing reactor safety. These projects not only sharpened my analytical skills but also introduced me to the transformative power of data. Managing my family’s business further solidified my passion for data by exposing me to the impact of data-driven decisions on real-world outcomes. Through hands-on projects, I developed proficiency in Python, SQL, and Power BI, and discovered the immense potential of leveraging data to solve challenges. I’m excited to blend my technical expertise with my enthusiasm for innovation to contribute meaningful solutions in **AI and Data Science**.
